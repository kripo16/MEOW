                Will You Marry Me?<br>
                Well honestly it should be Date me ... Again<br>
                (God I wish it was marriage proposal)<br>
                So basically i got couple of things to say, um uh ILY? which is rly obv and you alr know that<br>
                The thing isss you remember last time I proposed to you? well technically you were the one who proposed I js said the word.<br>
                So I figured that why not take my chance rn? cuz I always wanted to play the first move, well never been good at it.<br>
                But here I am lol, So i figured that how am I suppossed to propose to her? um uh? a normal proposal? like I js say ILY, CAN WE GET BACK TOGETHER and thats it?<br>
                Well that's what usually happens since we aint meeting irl, then I figured why not make her smth? since I am a coder and I LOVE HER, im rdy to put some time and effort into smth she will like.<br>
                I mean it is smth creative but still you deserve more.<br>
                Well tbh with you im not sure how you gon react to this for some valid reasons, but at the very least don't get mad at me okay? and like idk block me or wtv.<br>
                So yeahh<br><br>
                So Kwthr Yk I rly Love You, and Ik you feel the same, and i rly think we should give it another shot cuz I rly miss us<br>
                I want us to get closer again, cuz we meant for each other we like soulmates fr.<br>
                We were alr doing so fine, now i got more time i will be kinda free from familly things yk what i mean by that. so yeah we will have so much fun i promise its like i js want us to be together, yk im aiming for the long goal "MARRIAGE" so yeah wtv happens u mine alr
                And about the things u told me, yk they were never true u mean soo much to me u literally the reason im living rn (I MEAN IT LITERALLY)<br>
                So yeah if there was smth not doing enough in the relationship it was me<br>
                So what about a fresh start? continue where we left off and fix past mistakes (misunderstandings)<br>
                And about the BAC too, ik its gon be stressful and all I rly wanna be there for you, doesnt matter even if u decided to focus on ur studies and get off the phone when u comeback youll find me waiting for you
                See what im tryna say? like life your life I live mine we share things wtv we do yk like we used to exchange pics etc ... js me and yk slaying through life
                me helping you with everything I can, and ik youll do the same? SOOOOOOO?? <br><br><br>
                WHAT ARE YOU SAYING???????? NEW ACADEMIC YEAR New US??<br><br><br>
                And I hope you like this, i rly took a lot of time making it (5 Days, and literally 1000+ lines of code)
                (RN IM WAITING FOR U IN DISCORD)
